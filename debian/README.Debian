The package provides "versioned" packages with the real .jar files
and an unversioned package that supplies merely a symbolic link to
the .jar.  This way, later versions will replace earlier packages and
allow reverse-dependent projects to remain their functionality.

Versions 1.0.2, 1.1.6 and 1.2.1 of jibx are sadly not upwards
compatible.
